## Training Data
Lora training was done on a subset of ~650 videos and music captions from the [MM_Trail](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20962) dataset

## AI Use
Gemini 3 was used to assist in code-writing throughout the project. Specifically the Lora Training File `lora_llava.py` was mostly AI generated.
